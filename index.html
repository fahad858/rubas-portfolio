                Course By Jhankar Mahbub' at Programming Hero. I really hope to learn the basics of web development from
                this course and then practice as much as I can and learn more about the trait and become a
                freelance web developer and a trainer.

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a good web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
